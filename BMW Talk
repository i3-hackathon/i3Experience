but unfortunately has problems fitting in the living room unlike here
-> app -> always view car



QUESTIONS:

->forge intimate connection between driver and car
-> enlightened driving

 Innovation: is it an amazing new use case? User experience: does the app have a gorgeous user interface? Is it easy to use or to interact during the drive? 


 Market: which/how many people who could be delighted with the solution? 


 Integration: does the app make great use of BMW’s data or other relevant data (public data, use of external API’s etc.) 
-> BMW Car API
-> D3.js


 Quality of presentation: Make sure that the judges understand quickly your app, and what need it solves for whom and how



-> who you are, problem solving, showing/demo

2. Cannot appreciate car away from car
