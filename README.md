## BMW-Dashboard
BMW i3 Dashboard analytics with data logging. Done at BMW's Hackathon January 11, 2015 - [Hack the Drive](http://www.hackthedrive.com/). We used D3.js, Parse.com, BMW Car API and Here (maps). 

Our mobile web application took live data from the BMW Car API, and stored it in Parse.com. Later queried for specific values such as trip data and fuel levels to present to the end user.

Note: unfortunately web app no longer pulls real time data from the car, thus all current data is data that we had logged earlier onto Parse.com. Therefore dials and chart are no longer accurate.
